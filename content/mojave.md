The Mojave Desert is a vast area that reaches from Southern California and into Nevada. Though I am not 100% positive where the sand dune photo was taken, I marked the area called the Mesquite Flat Dunes in Death Valley National Park. It may have actually been taken somewhere else though.

Death Valley was land originally inhabited by the Western Shoshone people.
