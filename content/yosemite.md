Yosemite is one of the more famous National Parks and has the distinction of being the first piece of land set aside for conservation by the federal government during the Abraham Lincoln administration. This wallpaper photo is of Half Dome, which is a very distinctive mountain carved by glaciers tens of thousands of years ago.

This was land originally inhabited by the Miwok people.
